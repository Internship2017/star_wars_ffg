Planets and smaller masses are in constant orbit around many of these stars. Vast numbers of nebulae and other astronomical anomalies are also present throughout the galaxy. Traveling between the worlds of the galaxy requires at least a rudimentary knowledge of the galaxy’s organization and compo­ sition. It also requires a navicomputer that is up to date on the current time and relative motion of all of these objects. The Astrogation skill represents a character’s ability to use his knowledge of the galaxy to most effectively program the hyperspace coordi­ nates for any jump. It can also represent a charac­ ter’s knowledge of stellar locations, astronomy, and the formation of the galaxy.", "Examples"=>[{"example"=>"Programming a navicomputer for a hyperspace jump requires a successful Astrogation check."}, {"example"=>"Astrogation governs a character’s basic knowledge of galactic geography. It may be checked any time a character wonders what other systems are nearby."}, {"example"=>"In the event that characters arrive in an unknown system, they may use a navicomputer and their Astrogation skill to identify their location."}, {"example"=>"Astrogation also covers familiarity with the galaxy’s hyperspace routes and the types of craft and commerce most common along those routes."}], "Difficulty"=>"The difficulty of a hyperspace jump is based on the area targeted and the distance traveled. Travel to a nearby system along a well-established route is generally an Easy (1d8) check The difficulty increases based on the accuracy of navigational information and other factors. See page 252 for more information on hyperspace travel. \n Additional [success] beyond those required to calculate a hyperspace jump may be used to better target the location. While a single net [success] reaches the target system without incident, extras might place the character’s vessel directly into orbit around the target planet. Alternatively, characters may use additional [success] to reduce the time spent calculating, when rushed. \n [advantage] generated as part of an Astrogation check are most commonly used to reduce travel time. On extended journeys, they might be used to identify convenient stopovers en route, where the vessel can resupply or conduct additional business to help defray the cost of the trip. [triumph] could be spent either to com plete Astrogation calculations in the minimum amount of time, or to greatly reduce the travel time involved. It could also reveal some highly valuable but previously unknown information, such as a safer or quicker alternative route. \n Conversely, [disavantage] generated on an Astrogation check could decrease the accurracy or increase the travel time of hyperspace jump, or it could simply cause a character to miss relevant details when analyzing a hyperspace routes or galactic maps, [dispair] could be spent in the same way but to greater magnitude, or it could trigger some truly disastrous occurence, such as jumping out of hyperspace into the path of an asteroid."}, "Sources"=>{"Source"=>[{"page"=>"104", "source_book"=>"Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook"}, {"page"=>"116", "source_book"=>"Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook"}, {"page"=>"114", "source_book"=>"Force and Destiny Core Rulebook"}]}, "Characteristic"=>"Intellect", "Type"=>"General"}, {"Name"=>"Athletics", "Description"=>{"General"=>"Player Characters lead dramatic lives filled with con­ stant physical confrontation. Often, that confrontation comes from an enemy with a blaster, but sometimes it may be a mountain to be scaled, a river to be swum, or a chasm that must be leapt. The Athletics skill governs these actions. It serves as a measure of the character’s overall fitness and physical conditioning. Those who actively engage in a regimen of physical training, such as field infantry or scouts, are the most likely to have a high rank in Athletics.", "Examples"=>[{"example"=>"All aspects of climbing—including rappelling and swinging on a line—fall under the purview of the Athletics skill. The difficulty of these tasks is cal­ culated based on the surface, incline, and other basic conditions of the surface being climbed."}, {"example"=>"Characters who attempt to swim in difficult conditions must check their Athletics. Water conditions-particularly waves, current, and tides dictate the overall challenge of any effort to swim."}, {"example"=>"A character's vertical and horizontal jump are both determined through use of an Athetics check. Gravitational conditions and the distance required factor into the difficulty."}, {"example"=>"Most characters can run, but sprinting or running for an extended time falls under the purview of an Athletics check."}], "Difficulty"=>"The difficulty of an Athletics check is set by the severity of the task. Attempting to perform a routine task under normal conditions should never require a check. A more demanding task—jumping more than a person’s body length or staying afloat for hours should require [difficulty] commensurate with the difficulty of the task. Adverse conditions extreme rain, rough winds, or aggressive pursuit—could impose one or more [setback]. A combination of these elements can make a check significantly more challenging. Extremely adverse conditions hurricane force winds or a surface covered in oil—and attempts at superhuman feats may introduce one or more [1d12][difficulty], in addition to increasing the difficulty. \n Additional [success] on an Athetlics check can either reduce the time required to make the check or increse the distance traveled with that check. \n [advantage][advantage] on an Athletics check may be used to grant the character an additional maneuver during the course of his turn. The maneuver should be one that involves movement or some sort of physical activity. See page 206 for more information, and remember that characters can take a maximum of only two maneuvers during their turn. [advantage] can also generate bonus [bonusdice] on other physical checks performed by allies during that round, or on physical checks the character performs later. \n [triumph] results on successful checks should allow the character to perform the check with a truly impres­ sive outcome. Instead of heaving a boulder aside, he hurls it into the air; instead of grabbing onto the edge of a hovering platform, he uses his momentum to flip atop it, landing on his feet. \n As Athletics is generally used to perform physical actions, [disavantage] and [dispair] results should most often result in physical penalties. Small amounts of [disavantage] may cause the character to suffer strain, while larger amounts of [disavantage] may cause the character to fall prone, or even suffer a wound from sprains and bruises.

In any of these situations, Brawl is the skill used to determine success or failure in the combat. \n Most characters who grew up in a hostile environ­ ment have some knack for Brawl. All wildlife, par­ ticularly creatures with natural weapons, use Brawl to fight.

An individual with this knack is capable of giving just the right compli­ ment to his target—often by deciphering the subject’s social and cultural background. Note that the use of the Charm skill requires the acting character to main­ tain a degree of sincerity in his statements. A charac­ ter who employs flagrant flattery with no basis in real­ ity would be better suited to the Deception skill. See Social Skill Interactions, on the next page, for more information.

An exception is a situation in which the PC is trying to Charm a large group, in which case a set difficulty is usually employed. Of course, situational modifiers may also apply based upon the character’s style of dress, species, and other characteristics. For instances in which the desired outcome is directly opposed to the target’s interests, an additional [1d8][difficulty] may be added. \n For situations involving multiple subjects or a target predisposed to react favorably toward the charac­ ter, the character does not make an opposed check. Instead, the difficulty of the check is determined by the number of subjects and their disposition. Larger crowds or groups who are predisposed against the character’s desired outcome require a more difficult check, while charming those already partial to the character may require few, if any, [1d8][difficulty]. \n Extra [success] on a Charm check may be used to extend the target’s support for additional scenes. Each [success] spent in this way gains the character an extra scene in which the target is willing to support him. \n [advantage] may be spent to affect unexpected subjects beyond the original target. These may be bystanders or others who are not directly involved in the scene, but who may be able to aid the character in their own way. With [triumph], the player may choose to have a target NPC become a recurring character who remains predisposed to assist his character. This NPC may not join the character’s crew, but might offer a better than usual price for fencing goods, or may share certain Imperial secrets. \n [disavantage] and [dispair] are, conversely, harmful to a character’s standing with those he is trying to sway. [disavantage] may be spent to reduce the number of people the character is able to influence or to turn those affected negatively against the character.

Others may only grant respect to those whom they fear. When characters attempt to instill obedience in a target through the use of threats or acts of physical intimidation, they use Coercion.

However, even decent individuals may use Coercion to intimidate opponents into surrendering rather than fighting and killing their enemies.

In such circum­ stances, the difficulty of the check is determined by the number of subjects and their disposition. Larger crowds or groups that are more likely to resist authority require a more difficult check, while using Coercion on those already cowed by the character may require few, if any [1d8] [difficulty]. \n Extra [success] on a Coercion check may be used to inflict strain upon the target at a rate of 1 strain per [success][success]. \n By spending [advantage] [advantage] the character may affect unexpected subjects beyond the original target. These may be bystanders or others not directly involved in the scene, but who may be cowed by the character as a result of witnessing the Coercion attempt.

The new found follower may be exploited to gain additional information or assets, or even to serve as a spy within the ranks of a foe. However, if the follower’s betrayal is discovered by the foe, this forced loyalty may not prove permanent. \n Intimidation and strong-arm tactics are only as successful as the strength and thought behind the attempt. The GM may spend [disavantage] and [dispair] to undermine the outcome of a character’s Coercion attempt. Extra [disavantage] may be spent by the GM to represent a building resentment toward the coercing character. Regardless of the success or failure of the Coercion attempt, the subject may grow to despise the character as a result of having been strong-armed. [dispair] on the other hand, may be spent to represent the character’s slipping up and revealing something about his goals and motivations to the target.

In general, the more vital the materials protected by the system, the more difficult the system shouldbe to overcome. \n Additional [success] may be spent to reduce the time required for the action undertaken.
